Katzenpost Manifesto
====================


We stand here today on the brink of a revolution in privacy enhancing
technology. Encryption is not enough to resist traffic analysis. Our
resistance needs to be efficient enough to affect the most people
possible. We therefore must make use of statistical techniques. We
must make use of mix networks instead of simply writing academic
papers about them. A lot is at stake here. Not merely preventing human
rights violations but preventing the loss of our humanity. People need
privacy in order to remain human and humane. We are changing the way
communication takes place. Long live the revolution!
