From 
2.1.1 Directory Authority Server Schedule

   Directory Authority server interactions are conducted according to
   the following schedule, where T is the beginning of the current epoch.

   T                         - Epoch begins

   T + t_vote_exchange - Vote exchange begins

   T + t_vote_exchange + t_signature_exchange - Tabulation and signature exchange

   T + t_vote_exchange + t_signature_exchange + t_publish_consensus - Publish consensus

// Parametize the consensus schedule:

Let v, si, p denote the duration of time for each period described in the Authority schedule:
   t_vote_exchange, t_signature_exchange, t_publish_consensus.

Let n, a, c, denote the number of mixes, authorities and clients.

Let d, s, p denote the size of a MixDescriptor, Signature, and Consensus.

i.e. 
p = (n * d) + (a * s)

Let b_c denote the amount of bandwidth used to distribute the Consensus:

Each Directory Authority collects keys from each of the Mixes:
// XXX What happens if a minority of Directory Authorities have a MixDescriptor.
// Do the other Directory Authorities include these keys in the Consensus?
// Do Mixes send their descriptor to all of the Authorities?
// What happens if an Authority is unreachable e.g. Network Congestion, etc?


Each Mix exchanges a MixDescriptor with each Authority:
Let b_k denote the bandwidth used to distribute Mix keys:

b_k = n * d * a 

Each Authority exchanges a Vote
// XXX we assume that a Vote is the ordered list of MixDescriptors with a
// Signature and ignore any optimizations. 

Let b_v denote the bandwidth used to distribute a Vote between the Authorities.
Each Authority sends each other Authority a Vote, so for a Authorities:
a * (a - 1) = a^2 - a
And a Vote consists of (approximately) the MixDescriptors and a signature.
(n * d + s) * (a^2 - a)
b_v = (n * d + s) * (a^2 - a) 

And finally,

Let b_p denote the bandwidth used to distribute the final consensus to the
Mixes and clients.

b_p = (n * d  + s * a) * c

The total bandwidth used to fetch, vote, and distribute MixDescriptors is
then:

b_c = b_k + b_v + b_p

    = n * d * a  +  (n * d + s) * (a^2 - a)  +  (n * d + s * a) * c

    = n d a + b_v + b_p
    = n d a + b_k + s a + b_p
    = n d a + b_k + s a + ( n d + s a) c
    = n d a + n d a + s a + ( n d + s a) c
    = 2 n d a + s a + ( n d + s a) c
    = 2 n d a + s a + c n d + c s a
    = 2 n d a + s a + c n d + c s a

// XXX: it might make sense to find an expression for the
// number of mixes as a ratio to users,
// i.e.

k = n / c , where k is a knob for tuning the number of mixes proportionally to the number of clients
 n = k c

b = 2 (c k) d a + s a + c (c k) d + c s a
b = 2 c k d a + c^2 k d + c s a + s a

// The c^2 k term is interesting.
// Ideally k -> 1/c for linear scaling, ie, minimize n
// But this is at the expense of average bandwidth per client

// Now we need to know how to parametize k in terms of Network load

// Consider the amount of bandwidth required to distribute the pki information

Let kr denote the rekeying rate
kr

// k is the ratio of mixes to clients.

// clients per mix: k^-1

// XXX use proper parameter names
Let sm denote the size of a message

Let fm denote the frequency of sending a message

And cbr denote the client average bandwidth rate

cbr = sm fm * c

Let mbr denote the mix average bandwidth rate
Let nbr denote the network average bandwdith rate

nbr = cbr + kr b

// XXX how do we model mbr accurately?
mbr = nbr / n

// clients = number of mixes * clients per mix = n/k
nbr = (n/k) * cbr

k nbr = n cbr

k = n cbr / nbr

// Set up the equation in terms of mix average bandwidth
nbr = n mbr

n mbr = (n/k) cbr
mbr = ((n/k) cbr)n^-1
mbr = cbr/k
// solve for a value of mbr that seems realistic
Let mbr be .5 GB/s

// Now pick a value for cbr :)
// XXX: assume client needs a covert channel of
// bandwith
Let bc = capacity required for covert channel

// q theory for bandwidth = rtt * payload ?
bc = payload_size / rtt

  // experimental values:
  // try rtt -> 300 ms, 1 s, ..., 600 s
  // for payload_size -> 512B, 1KB, ..., 1MB
  // number of clients -> 5K, 10K, ..., 16 M // ha
  bc = 512 / .3 // low latency, short messages
  bc = 512 / 5 // med latency, short messages
  bc = 5M / 600 // high latency, large messages
  
// XXX How much cover traffic is needed to provide
// how much uncertainty? How are these units
// defined?
// bandwith cover required
// nsr = ratio noise / signal
  // experimental values
  // try nsr -> idgaf, 2, 9, 99
cbr = nsr * bc
mbr = cbr / k

solve for k
mbr = (nsr * bc) / k
k = (nsr * bc) / mbr

// an example with an assumed mix average bandwidth rate at .5GB
// and bc = 512b/.3s, nsr = 2
k = (2 * 512b/.3) / .5*10^9b
clients per mix = 1 / k 

Interesting things to plot
	number of mix nodes for 5k, 10k, 100k, 1M, 16M clients:
	amount of bw used for consensus vs network bandwidth

Each Authority downloads new MixDescriptors from the other Authorities.


available for retreival. Upon receiving a new vote, the authority
examines it for new descriptors and fetches them from that
// XXX 

Each Directory Authority exchanges 

b = p * (n + a + c) 

// XXX What Documents are in the pki that Authorities vote on?
// XXX What number of clients, mixes, authorities are expected to be supported with
// the current parameters?
